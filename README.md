# Student Directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy
It is a command line application.

Functionality includes:
* Adding students
  * Manual input
  * Load from CSV
* Save students to csv
* View current students
* Filter students
  * by first letter of name
  * number of characters in name
  * by cohort
  
  The base functionality of the exercise was extended to try and understand a different programme design - using classes and introduced some tests - all beyond scope of what was originally expected.

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby bin/main.rb [option to load file]
```
Then follow on-screen instructions
